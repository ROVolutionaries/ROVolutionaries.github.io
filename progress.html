                <p>Today, I worked on making the CAD model for the fish catcher. The image below shows a drawing that David made, which the model would be based on. The first model I created was made from 2 ovals, however, it was later switched to a more rounded rectangle shape. After creating these shapes, I made the hinge mechanism, which will try to be a print-in-place mechanism. This is in an attempt to make manufacturing much easier. The final product will put a net on either side, one being flat and the other being like a fish net extending to the back. It will use a waterproof servo to close. To finish the product, I need to test the print-in-place mechanism, add the compliant mechanism, and add bolt holes to hold the net.</p>

                <p>I modified the main linear mechanism by adding gears and a container for the linear actuator. Because I didn’t have the CAD file for the linear actuator, I found it quite difficult to model and properly make a container for it that would keep the linear actuator from moving at an angle. As you can see in this <a href="https://youtu.be/E-dHsgfKOfo">video</a>, it was a complete disappointment and a waste of PLA. The print was also very low quality as we were in a hurry (here is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SJOKX2HULdFf48tS1fz4IHvbFKGeJHQl/view?usp=sharing">STEP file</a>). Additionally, I had not considered the electrical side of this problem. To test the entire gripper, I headed to Konstantin’s house. For the design to work, I expected the linear actuator to be able to stop at a certain point, but this is very difficult given that it only has two power wires without any signal or something that is able to detect the extension. Thus, when retracting the linear actuator to close the gripper, we found that the linear actuator actually crushes the print and completely broke the coupler while squashing the slider piece. Also, I noticed that the linear actuator axle couldnt retract fully (though it wasn’t a large difference if you see the image below), suggesting that it has probably skipped a few gears internally. When I left, the electrical engineer was able to fit the gear onto the M200 motor and was able to rotate the gripper as seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/4bq-KlKKDm0">this video</a>. We had a discussion and decided the best way to reduce the chances of breaking the gripper was to add a stiff spring that wouldn’t allow the linear actuator to skip gears for some time while there is current sensing to see if there is excess force applied. From this experience and the feedback given from the electrical engineer, there should be changes such as:<br />
- Increased tolerance for the parts that are connected to the components such as the linear actuator housing or gear held by the M200<br />
- Decreased tolerance for parts that are related to the axle <br />
- Remove the sliding component that attaches to the linear actuator housing and replace with something else <br />
- A spring mechanism<br />
- A gripper that has a long axle <br />
- The use of the linear actuators' built-in stopping point helps prevent damage to components by avoiding crushing</p>

                <p>Today we tested 2 new pieces of equipment, the HDPE and the pump. For the HDPE we wanted to make sure it was positively buoyant. Me and ati clogged a sink, and filled it up with water. Then we put the HDPE panel in, and made sure it floated, which it did. Next for the pump where there are 2 things me and Ahmed tested for. Firstly if the pump worked, and secondly if we could store the water in a container. We filled a cup with water, and tested the pump normally, and it worked. However, when we added the container to the pump, no water was being sucked in from the cup. We realized this was because there were open holes in the container, meaning air was pumped instead of water. So to test our idea, we first covered the holes in scotch tape. Once we realized this was the issue we wanted a more permanent solution, so we epoxy sealed every hole around the container.</p>

                <p>Gripper V1 is the first prototype compatible with our electrical components: Bluerobotics M200 motor and HAKIWO IP68 Waterproof 12V Linear Actuator. We chose the linear actuator as the opening and closing mechanism mainly because it is seen in other products like BlueRobotics and Reach Robotics. It could provide adequate force and speed without expensive parts due to the waterproofing. The gripper was designed to be able to hold round objects up to 3 inches in diameter. It has been designed to be as compact as possible, with the linear actuator axle coupling directly to the gripper mechanism. As the linear actuator’s axle is only 50 mm and the gripper extension mechanism is around 20 mm, we have to fit everything (the couple, the boot, and the gear/gripper holder) in 30 mm only. To save space, the coupler is placed between the gear/gripper holder and the gripper. I have also tested it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOtYzAC4DQQ">video</a>), and found that I needed to decrease the clearance. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LBXtrs9frGWZF6YYzrJ2XitwoCb6P3K2/view?usp=sharing">Here</a> is the STEP file.</p>

                <p>The specifications of the grabber arm necessitate 360-degree rotation of the grabber. Since the mechanism will be exposed to the water, the only feasible motor to achieve this rotation is the BlueRobotics M200, which is a brushless DC motor (BLDC). Most BLDC drive algorithms are optimized to run the motor at high RPM (more than 100 RPM minimum is typical). The Field-Oriented Control algorithm on the other hand allows much better control at low speeds, and is used widely in robotics with BLDC motors as powerful rotary actuators. The caveat is, however, that FOC algorithms generally need a position sensor to provide feedback on the motor’s angle. After researching implementations of such algorithms, I found the SimpleFOC library, which provides an open-loop (no sensor) implementation. This library is perfect for our application, since it can be used with low-cost common hardware. However, the disadvantage of open-loop control is lower torque. To verify the suitability of this implementation I built a prototype, which simply rotated the motor at low speeds continuously. I used a low power motor driver IC, which in the final design will be replaced by one with higher power output. The torque was not high as predicted, however the motion was very smooth. Torque will be higher in the final design due to higher current, and a gear reduction will be used on the grabber for both higher torque and finer rotation control.</p>

                <p>Last year, our float didn’t work mainly because our stepper motor couldn’t provide enough force to pull the syringes (which also required quite a bit of force to pull). Thus, it was important that we calculated if the stepper motor had enough torque. I did this by first testing how much force is required to pull a syringe as seen in this video. The max force was probably 6 kg (which is a lot). Thus, my dad suggested that I cut the syringe’s head, which reduced the max force to 2.5 kg, so three syringes takes around 75 newtons. I haven’t really taken proper physics classes yet, so I headed to ChatGPT to see if my stepper motor was capable of applying this much force. </p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006104443954.html">spec sheet</a>, it had 0.34 N*m of holding torque, and it calculated that the force able to be produced would be 80 N, which is above 75 N. Thus, it would probably be able to deliver enough force, and if not, we can use planetary gears to increase the torque.</p>

                <p>I have spent a long time summarizing all the mechanisms I saw, but I wanted to achieve a gripper that can rotate indefinitely. One day, I had an idea of separating two input motions from one singular axis. I sketched it a couple of times and prototyped it on CAD. My first prototype was a failure. Instead of making my own gears, I decided to incorporate lego gears, and it was too small, imprecise, and fragile. It wasn’t functional and broke immediately when I removed the supports. Thus, I looked for a few tutorials to create my own gears and created a much larger model. As you can see in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rSkOZ6gRzAY">this</a> video, the rotary and linear motion inputs can produce a desirable output.</p>
