                <p>Throughout the year, I emphasized to our main software engineer, Ahmed, how important it was for us to be able to stabilize the ROV with PID as most high-scoring teams on the product demonstration had something like that, and it makes sense for many precision tasks that came out. However, we already came across multiple problems. A mentor that has a PhD in ROVs came up to us telling us how our max current draw is extremely low and it was important to assume maximum thrust from all thrusters to divide the current draw for each. We later on asked other teams on the Discord server, and they disagreed, saying that we should assume that there is no limit until it exceeds the limit, which it should then split the current (probably because this is a pool competition rather than an actual ROV). I’m not too sure about the specifics, but I believe it was also important to know the general thrust output of each thruster based on the PWM signal in case they were different. I watched a video from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_amdMnDMS4&amp;t=784s">Brick Experiment Channel</a> that has a clever solution to measuring the force applied. Thus, we created a setup like shown below, where we used lego to connect a <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/t200-to-lego-connector-1">3D printed part</a> that is bolted on to the T200. There were a few problems with this setup that we are planning on improving. At the start, the T200 didn’t run because of problems with the code. Then, when it ran, it was stalling (like sometimes twitching, sometimes moving), but when we rotated it the other way, it spun normally. So, Omar kickstarted the T200 by moving it and it spun normally. Also, the lego extends out from the scale and is connected by tape, the <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/yziKkib4t5Q">scale tilts</a> due to the T200. </p>
<p>Thus, we will improve the setup by adding weights on one side and redo everything.</p>

                <p>These days, I have been working on sealing and joining the gripper and the float. So far, the o-ring seal has been successful, which shouldn’t be surprising but is definitely surprising to me. For the float flange, I designed it so that there would be a flat surface (the acrylic) and it compresses the o-ring towards a resin printed groove. From what I read, the optimal compression should be a 25% compression, and allowing DeepSeek to do all the math (ID=88mm, OD=95mm, CS=3.5mm), the groove depth should be around 2.5 mm, and the groove width should be around 4 mm. However, due to the lack of experience, I made the groove depth more shallow at 2 mm with a max compression of 42.9%. This way we could always increase the pressure in case it doesn’t work but it doesn’t go above 42.9% to avoid damaging the o-ring further (in case a team member is assigned with assembling the float). </p>
<p>Yesterday, I finished sealing the flange with epoxy and the nitrile rubber o-rings arrived, so Omar and I added the o-rings and compressed the o-ring with a few bolts (we didn’t have enough hex nuts, so we couldn’t fill the 12 holes, but rather did around 5 that were evenly spaced, but the final should probably have all 12 to distribute the pressure on the o-ring). Because Omar didn’t understand how the o-rings worked, they didn’t leave a gap in some areas of the face seal (and the 3mm acrylic kind of bends). This may cause the <a href="https://eriks.com/en/know-how-hub/blogs/o-ring-degradation-characteristics-causes-solutions/">o-ring to degrade</a>. After some DeepSeek calculations, the gap between the flanges should be around 0.5 mm to 1 mm.</p>

                <p>As a part of the manufacturing team, one of the biggest headaches we had was figuring out how to use the Ultimaker Printers to print out our TPU springs without it completely failing. And looking back, I’d say it;s because we weren’t properly trained on them; we technically did but there's so much to learn about these printers (such as the dual extrusion, the printer cores, bed leveling, etc.), we simply didn’t have enough time to get through all of it, and at the time it seemed pretty unnecessary. </p>
<p>The first issue that I had to overcome was the bed leveling. Often the prints wouldn’t adhere to the print bed, and ultimately fail, which was due to an issue with the machine itself, hence the PCL staff helped us fix that. The next issue was printer core in the Ultimaker printers. The printer core refers to the extruder used for filaments, and each specific filament has their own preferred printer core, which after a lot of trial and error with the PCL staff, we learnt that the optimum for TPU was AA 0.4. Finally the final issue I had to overcome was dual extrusion; essentially when printing complex shapes such as our springs, there needs to be a lot of support, which TPU is not good for, hence I had to learn to configure the printer such that it would print supports in another filament (such as Breakaway white), to ensure we had a clean print. With all of them obstacles sorted out, I now hope that 3D printing on the Ultimaker will be significantly easier.</p>

                <p>Over the course of the past 2 weeks, we have unfortunately suffered from delays in the manufacturing process. These delays came with the difficulty in cutting one of our key frame components; the HDPE side plates. These side plates are simply a 2D cut onto 3D material. Our first instinct was to lasercut the material as this was the most efficient and precise method. Unfortunately, after extensive research, we learned that HDPE releases toxic fumes that are dangerous for both the operator of the laser cutter and the laser cutter exhaust mechanism itself. Our next idea was to use the waterjets available at HFL to cut the HDPE. These were ideal as they operated similarly to laser cutters but used high pressure jets of water to cut through the material. In this way, no toxic fumes would have been released. Unfortunately, the water jets that were available were under maintenance due to technical errors in their water output. We then met with Woodrow and Ali to discuss how we could possibly cut the HDPE side plates. They suggested using the Woodpecker CNC machine available at the IFL. This also operated similarly to a laser cutter but was more manual and operated using a drill bit. To help us with this we acquired the help of Jamaal at the IFL. Jamaal helped us to develop our Fusion 360 design using the manufacturing tab to create a suitable file for the CNC to read. We first prototyped this design on some spare plywood of 8mm thickness at IFL. The major issues we ran into are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Z axis starting position was too low and required us to manually adjust the Gcode to manually set the Z starting position </li>
<li>Different sized holes on the HDPE side plate file meant that we had to continuously change drill bits throughout the cutting process</li>
<li>HDPE plate size was almost the exact dimension of the HDPE material available. This forced us to center our design on the corner of the material to leave ourselves as much clearance as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Today as we were cutting the HDPE side plate, we realized we had made a huge mistake. We accidentally centered the cut file 4 mm to the right of the corner of the HDPE material. As a result, every bolt hole was adjusted 4mm to the right. This could have caused a huge problem as the HDPE side plate would not have fit on the available material and would also not have connected properly to the Aluminium. To combat this, we simply recentered the design and cut the bolt holes again. We ensured to adjust any dimensions to ensure that no holes overlapped. As a result, one of the HDPE side plates has two sets of bolt holes. This might end up working in our favor as it provides modularity which can be used for ballast or even attachment of tooling. Additionally, the extra set of holes serve as a powerful reminder of the struggles and challenges we had to overcome to get to where we are as a team today. This is a powerful symbol that our ROV incorporates.</p>

                <p>I received the TPU prints (finally!). Apparently the manufacturing team had a huge difficulty in printing in TPU. They printed with the wrong extruders at PCL multiple times, so it took a few weeks for the parts to come. In fact, they even printed my part in durable resin once, but I thought the material was a bit too stiff. </p>
<p>The TPU print was very bad quality since Shiva chose the wrong support material, but it helped me recognize the problems and potential solutions. I explained everything in the 7-minute yap session <a href="https://youtu.be/rvyLVZWc7QA">here</a> because Ahmed wanted to know what's going on (also something I forgot to mention: the first design was actually inspired by a hinge compliant mechanism I saw before where it is a circle, then I realized the shape is basically the same shape as when the spring is being compressed). As stated in the video, I’m not a professional mechanical engineer and compliant mechanisms are far beyond what I can do, so most of the stuff is just either yap or just pure instinct (hopefully the design works though).</p>

                <p>With great success from our last session, we decided it was time to cut our final pieces. We liaised with the PCL inventory to acquire a full new sheet of aluminum for our purposes, and travelled to the HFL to set up the machinery for our purposes. After exporting the aluminum flat patterns as DXF files, and transferring them to the machinery, we were ready to cut. It was during the cutting we realized a mistake on our part. Whilst cutting out the voronoi pattern on the aluminum, the cut pieces didn’t fall through, which sometimes hindered the machine, hence we had to manually stop the machine and remove those pieces every time before continuing. However this was easy as the laser cutter had an extremely high precision and the aluminum was locked in place. Once we were done, we removed the pieces and began to sand it for safety purposes, however we had to stop due to time restrictions. Our plan moving forward would be to come in next week on a Monday to sand/finish the aluminum, bend it to our specifications and use the waterjet if we have enough time.</p>

                <p>With plans to cut the final frame very soon, we took a trip to the PCL one more time in which we had a 90 minute sessions with the chief engineers and designers to fully solidify our design, ensuring there are no points of failure, and that we are able to easily manufacturer it with the PCL facilities. This involved taking precision measurements of the aluminum, and accounting for the bending. Thankfully this was all correct, and then we moved onto the bending process. We initially planned on “etching ” into the aluminum to aid us with the bending process, however this machine lacked those capabilities, thus we decided to take more precision measurements of where the bends begin, which we can input into the bending machine for ease. I unfortunately had to leave shortly after finalizing how to bend the aluminum, however my colleague Atisam stayed behind to test this process to ensure this will be feasible in the future.</p>

                <p>Today I visited the HFL (Harbor Fabrication Lab) to learn how to use the Accurpress machine. This machine is used for bending sheets of Aluminium. This will be a vital process for our frame manufacturing which will involve two sheets of bent Aluminium. I worked with Woodrow from PCL to learn how to first use the machine. The way it works is pretty ingenious and involves a hammer piece pressing into a mold piece. The machine works by having the operator press down to push the Aluminium together at an angle. I practiced the specific cuts we would need for the ROV frame on spare Aluminium sheets that were available at HFL. The specific cut angle I really wanted to practice was the 135o angle bend. This was difficult because such an angle often distorted the shape of the Aluminium sheet making it harder to bend the next piece. The biggest thing I learned that will be vital for the actual bending process is to always start by ending the inner pieces first. This way the alignment of the outer bends is not affected too much by what is happening on the inside. This makes it much easier to ensure secondary and tertiary bends are done precisely.</p>

                <p>With the deadline for the frame fast approaching, we decided to learn the process of laser cutting metal and testing out the bolt holes, to fundamentally understand how we would manufacture our ROV frame, and take notes of any questions or issues we ran into. By doing this, we hope to eliminate any points of failure whilst constructing and fabricating the frame, whilst also changing the design to meet the specifications of the machinery available to us. </p>
<p>Hence we took a trip to the PCL, where we contacted one of their staff to aid us with this experiment/learning. We had beforehand sent them a test file, filled with different variations of clearance holes to determine which best suited our needs. It was here we learnt that they had an industry standard for the machinery they used, hence we changed the file according to their specifications; m3 bolts had a clearance size of 3.3 mm, whilst m6 bolts had a clearance of 6.5 mm. Once corrected, we transferred to the Harbour Fabrication Lab (HFL), where we were introduced to the 6KW “Fiber Laser Cutting Machine”, and learnt about the different  processes it was capable of. Unfortunately, as 16-year old PCL users, we were not allowed to directly use the machine, but rather watched as the staff aided once. Once the lasercut was finished, we sanded the sharp edges (for safety purposes), and tested the bolt holes. We noticed that the m3 bolt holes were perfect, however there was a little too much wiggle room for the m6, hence in the actual design, we decided to change the m6 clearance hole to 6.4 mm.</p>

                <p>Today we tested 2 new pieces of equipment, the HDPE and the pump. For the HDPE we wanted to make sure it was positively buoyant. Me and ati clogged a sink, and filled it up with water. Then we put the HDPE panel in, and made sure it floated, which it did. Next for the pump where there are 2 things me and Ahmed tested for. Firstly if the pump worked, and secondly if we could store the water in a container. We filled a cup with water, and tested the pump normally, and it worked. However, when we added the container to the pump, no water was being sucked in from the cup. We realized this was because there were open holes in the container, meaning air was pumped instead of water. So to test our idea, we first covered the holes in scotch tape. Once we realized this was the issue we wanted a more permanent solution, so we epoxy sealed every hole around the container.</p>

                <p>Our team procrastinated a lot last year, and even with the motivation, we didn’t have the correct equipment or materials to build a proper ROV. Even the act of borrowing a capsule or a dome from CMR would have been considered unfathomable and extraordinary. Almost all our work was done at the last minute, where we worked from 3pm to 6pm for the week and 10 am to 3 am the night before the competition, where we finally understood our tasks and how to complete them rather than meeting once every week for a discussion led by our CEO to brainstorm ideas but with no substance or follow a manual to solder the TriggerFish. A few of us literally carried the ROV, the team, and a few whale sharks on their shoulders. Ahmed, our CTO, worked tirelessly to figure out how to put together the electronics from almost no experience. Although the programming was supposed to be split with another member, he ended up having to do all of it himself at 6am before the competition after only sleeping for 3 hours. You could tell his brain was fried in the images after the regionals, how he cut and soldered the ethernet cable without inserting it through the capsule countless times, how he connected the float’s fuse in parallel, how he connected the rasberry pi directly into the power supply and burnt the fuse, or how he soldered and epoxied the wires without thinking of putting the o-rings. Although Konstantin wasn’t in our team, he helped Ahmed a lot, coming over at late nights to help debug. Finally, Iyad and I were a bit slow sometimes, but we tried extremely hard to complete the mechanical side of the ROV. We had a joke about how Iyad doesn’t care about safety at all. When trying to remove a piece of PVC that was stuck, he would use all types of methods from cutting it with a knife to using the soldering iron to heat it up. To waterproof a motor for our gripper, we literally put it in a PVC, added a bunch of vaseline, hotglue, and epo putty (we used epo putty a lot for waterproofing and holding things together). Finally, I spent a lot of time trying to make the float work as it was the only thing that was relatively difficult mechanically. I spent a lot of time designing it on CAD at home and building it with Iyad (and it was extremely slow as the manufacturing team spent like a few weeks before bringing the prints). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLjwAGBiGK0">Here</a>'s a video of what happened last year. </p>
<p>Right after our failure at the Regionals competition, we went right to work, researching for how to make the float and gripper more reliable and to actually function. The hype eventually died down, and when we regrouped the next year, everything seemed like deja vu. There was no urgency and the communications went completely radio silent among the team. After looking at a lot of technical documentation and comparing ourselves with the Red Sea Robotics team, the team that qualified from regionals from KAUST, I realized that funding was critical and that history would repeat itself if we couldn’t fight against the tide. I compiled an extensive funding contact list with Iyad and urged our CEO to email many people. I also brainstormed all the parts that were necessary for building the ROV and the float with Ahmed and Iyad, and compiled a Google Sheet for all the online purchases (during this time we found that although Ahmed promised that he would secure us 3 T200s from the leftover KCRI funding of last year, we found that they all belonged to the other team because they put it on the sheet. I was pretty angry because they never told me about such an important topic and they fumbled the things that required the most money). Thus, we were literally working from scratch while facing the brutality of the IB curriculum. Despite making the tasks for the CEO extremely easy (he only had to write emails), he wasn’t willing to put in the effort and wanted to delay. Additionally, he had policies that were similar to last year, not understanding the requirements to build a ROV or a clear understanding of the scoring. Iyad and I had to buy a lot of float components from AliExpress with our own money. Because I really wanted to win, we had multiple heated arguments, which finally led to a meeting where I introduced Ahmed as our new CEO (although I could’ve lead the team due to my overall understanding of the tasks, I thought I wasn’t suitable for a leadership position in a company that requires members to do a lot of work but doesn’t have any punishments for disobeying because I was impatient with people who didn’t meet my expectations). Most of the other members complied with Ahmed being a temporary CEO to see whether it would make us more efficient, and it did. Ahmed had a much better understanding of the tasks, and moreover he would actually listen to what I have to say rather than ignore me completely because I spoke poorly of them. We organized meetings and brainstormed tasks for all the members. However, we were still in rough seas. Most of the people we emailed completely ignored us or didn’t have the ability to fund us. Luckily, out of all our emails, KCRI, CMR, and PCL were eager to meet with us. The meetings went extremely well (especially with KCRI) as we were able to show my frame design, the website I made, and ask for a specific amount of money as I basically finalized the expenses sheet. However, we ran into challenges as our supervisor wanted us to delay our funding so that she could secure funding for the regional competition and we were kind of ghosted by KCRI. Thus, we looked for connections to see if anyone’s parents were in key positions. One member in the team’s dad was able to fund but we ran into risks of embezzlement and conflict of interest. Thankfully, we contacted a friend’s dad who worked at KCRI and he immediately sent our supervisors the money after a few meetings. Additionally, a few members had relations with PCL from the WISER internship (and we heard that the other team worked there), and we met with the staff to talk about what was offered to us. </p>
<p>The team met a lot of uncertainty and difficulties in team management and funding, but now we organize ourselves, it’s smooth sailing.</p>

                <p>The specifications of the grabber arm necessitate 360-degree rotation of the grabber. Since the mechanism will be exposed to the water, the only feasible motor to achieve this rotation is the BlueRobotics M200, which is a brushless DC motor (BLDC). Most BLDC drive algorithms are optimized to run the motor at high RPM (more than 100 RPM minimum is typical). The Field-Oriented Control algorithm on the other hand allows much better control at low speeds, and is used widely in robotics with BLDC motors as powerful rotary actuators. The caveat is, however, that FOC algorithms generally need a position sensor to provide feedback on the motor’s angle. After researching implementations of such algorithms, I found the SimpleFOC library, which provides an open-loop (no sensor) implementation. This library is perfect for our application, since it can be used with low-cost common hardware. However, the disadvantage of open-loop control is lower torque. To verify the suitability of this implementation I built a prototype, which simply rotated the motor at low speeds continuously. I used a low power motor driver IC, which in the final design will be replaced by one with higher power output. The torque was not high as predicted, however the motion was very smooth. Torque will be higher in the final design due to higher current, and a gear reduction will be used on the grabber for both higher torque and finer rotation control.</p>

                <p>Last year, our float didn’t work mainly because our stepper motor couldn’t provide enough force to pull the syringes (which also required quite a bit of force to pull). Thus, it was important that we calculated if the stepper motor had enough torque. I did this by first testing how much force is required to pull a syringe as seen in this video. The max force was probably 6 kg (which is a lot). Thus, my dad suggested that I cut the syringe’s head, which reduced the max force to 2.5 kg, so three syringes takes around 75 newtons. I haven’t really taken proper physics classes yet, so I headed to ChatGPT to see if my stepper motor was capable of applying this much force. </p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006104443954.html">spec sheet</a>, it had 0.34 N*m of holding torque, and it calculated that the force able to be produced would be 80 N, which is above 75 N. Thus, it would probably be able to deliver enough force, and if not, we can use planetary gears to increase the torque.</p>
