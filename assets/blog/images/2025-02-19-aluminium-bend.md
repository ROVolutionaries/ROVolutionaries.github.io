Today I visited the HFL (Harbor Fabrication Lab) to learn how to use the Accurpress machine. This machine is used for bending sheets of Aluminium. This will be a vital process for our frame manufacturing which will involve two sheets of bent Aluminium. I worked with Woodrow from PCL to learn how to first use the machine. The way it works is pretty ingenious and involves a hammer piece pressing into a mold piece. The machine works by having the operator press down to push the Aluminium together at an angle. I practiced the specific cuts we would need for the ROV frame on spare Aluminium sheets that were available at HFL. The specific cut angle I really wanted to practice was the 135o angle bend. This was difficult because such an angle often distorted the shape of the Aluminium sheet making it harder to bend the next piece. The biggest thing I learned that will be vital for the actual bending process is to always start by ending the inner pieces first. This way the alignment of the outer bends is not affected too much by what is happening on the inside. This makes it much easier to ensure secondary and tertiary bends are done precisely.
