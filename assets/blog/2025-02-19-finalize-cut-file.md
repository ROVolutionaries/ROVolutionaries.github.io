With plans to cut the final frame very soon, we took a trip to the PCL one more time in which we had a 90 minute sessions with the chief engineers and designers to fully solidify our design, ensuring there are no points of failure, and that we are able to easily manufacturer it with the PCL facilities. This involved taking precision measurements of the aluminum, and accounting for the bending. Thankfully this was all correct, and then we moved onto the bending process. We initially planned on “etching ” into the aluminum to aid us with the bending process, however this machine lacked those capabilities, thus we decided to take more precision measurements of where the bends begin, which we can input into the bending machine for ease. I unfortunately had to leave shortly after finalizing how to bend the aluminum, however my colleague Atisam stayed behind to test this process to ensure this will be feasible in the future.
