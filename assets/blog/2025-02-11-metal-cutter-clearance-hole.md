With the deadline for the frame fast approaching, we decided to learn the process of laser cutting metal and testing out the bolt holes, to fundamentally understand how we would manufacture our ROV frame, and take notes of any questions or issues we ran into. By doing this, we hope to eliminate any points of failure whilst constructing and fabricating the frame, whilst also changing the design to meet the specifications of the machinery available to us. 

Hence we took a trip to the PCL, where we contacted one of their staff to aid us with this experiment/learning. We had beforehand sent them a test file, filled with different variations of clearance holes to determine which best suited our needs. It was here we learnt that they had an industry standard for the machinery they used, hence we changed the file according to their specifications; m3 bolts had a clearance size of 3.3 mm, whilst m6 bolts had a clearance of 6.5 mm. Once corrected, we transferred to the Harbour Fabrication Lab (HFL), where we were introduced to the 6KW “Fiber Laser Cutting Machine”, and learnt about the different  processes it was capable of. Unfortunately, as 16-year old PCL users, we were not allowed to directly use the machine, but rather watched as the staff aided once. Once the lasercut was finished, we sanded the sharp edges (for safety purposes), and tested the bolt holes. We noticed that the m3 bolt holes were perfect, however there was a little too much wiggle room for the m6, hence in the actual design, we decided to change the m6 clearance hole to 6.4 mm.
