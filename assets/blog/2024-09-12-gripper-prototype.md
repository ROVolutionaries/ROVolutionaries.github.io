I have spent a long time summarizing all the mechanisms I saw, but I wanted to achieve a gripper that can rotate indefinitely. One day, I had an idea of separating two input motions from one singular axis. I sketched it a couple of times and prototyped it on CAD. My first prototype was a failure. Instead of making my own gears, I decided to incorporate lego gears, and it was too small, imprecise, and fragile. It wasnâ€™t functional and broke immediately when I removed the supports. Thus, I looked for a few tutorials to create my own gears and created a much larger model. As you can see in [this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rSkOZ6gRzAY) video, the rotary and linear motion inputs can produce a desirable output.
