I received the TPU prints (finally!). Apparently the manufacturing team had a huge difficulty in printing in TPU. They printed with the wrong extruders at PCL multiple times, so it took a few weeks for the parts to come. In fact, they even printed my part in durable resin once, but I thought the material was a bit too stiff. 

The TPU print was very bad quality since Shiva chose the wrong support material, but it helped me recognize the problems and potential solutions. I explained everything in the 7-minute yap session [here](https://youtu.be/rvyLVZWc7QA) because Ahmed wanted to know what's going on (also something I forgot to mention: the first design was actually inspired by a hinge compliant mechanism I saw before where it is a circle, then I realized the shape is basically the same shape as when the spring is being compressed). As stated in the video, Iâ€™m not a professional mechanical engineer and compliant mechanisms are far beyond what I can do, so most of the stuff is just either yap or just pure instinct (hopefully the design works though).
