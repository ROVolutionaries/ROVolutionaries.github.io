Over the course of the past 2 weeks, we have unfortunately suffered from delays in the manufacturing process. These delays came with the difficulty in cutting one of our key frame components; the HDPE side plates. These side plates are simply a 2D cut onto 3D material. Our first instinct was to lasercut the material as this was the most efficient and precise method. Unfortunately, after extensive research, we learned that HDPE releases toxic fumes that are dangerous for both the operator of the laser cutter and the laser cutter exhaust mechanism itself. Our next idea was to use the waterjets available at HFL to cut the HDPE. These were ideal as they operated similarly to laser cutters but used high pressure jets of water to cut through the material. In this way, no toxic fumes would have been released. Unfortunately, the water jets that were available were under maintenance due to technical errors in their water output. We then met with Woodrow and Ali to discuss how we could possibly cut the HDPE side plates. They suggested using the Woodpecker CNC machine available at the IFL. This also operated similarly to a laser cutter but was more manual and operated using a drill bit. To help us with this we acquired the help of Jamaal at the IFL. Jamaal helped us to develop our Fusion 360 design using the manufacturing tab to create a suitable file for the CNC to read. We first prototyped this design on some spare plywood of 8mm thickness at IFL. The major issues we ran into are listed below:

- Z axis starting position was too low and required us to manually adjust the Gcode to manually set the Z starting position 
- Different sized holes on the HDPE side plate file meant that we had to continuously change drill bits throughout the cutting process
- HDPE plate size was almost the exact dimension of the HDPE material available. This forced us to center our design on the corner of the material to leave ourselves as much clearance as possible

Today as we were cutting the HDPE side plate, we realized we had made a huge mistake. We accidentally centered the cut file 4 mm to the right of the corner of the HDPE material. As a result, every bolt hole was adjusted 4mm to the right. This could have caused a huge problem as the HDPE side plate would not have fit on the available material and would also not have connected properly to the Aluminium. To combat this, we simply recentered the design and cut the bolt holes again. We ensured to adjust any dimensions to ensure that no holes overlapped. As a result, one of the HDPE side plates has two sets of bolt holes. This might end up working in our favor as it provides modularity which can be used for ballast or even attachment of tooling. Additionally, the extra set of holes serve as a powerful reminder of the struggles and challenges we had to overcome to get to where we are as a team today. This is a powerful symbol that our ROV incorporates.
