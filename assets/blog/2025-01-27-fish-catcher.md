Today, I worked on making the CAD model for the fish catcher. The image below shows a drawing that David made, which the model would be based on. The first model I created was made from 2 ovals, however, it was later switched to a more rounded rectangle shape. After creating these shapes, I made the hinge mechanism, which will try to be a print-in-place mechanism. This is in an attempt to make manufacturing much easier. The final product will put a net on either side, one being flat and the other being like a fish net extending to the back. It will use a waterproof servo to close. To finish the product, I need to test the print-in-place mechanism, add the compliant mechanism, and add bolt holes to hold the net.
