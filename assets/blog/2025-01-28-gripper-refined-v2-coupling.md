I discovered print in place mechanisms. Thus I wanted to try and make a coupler that is printed in place that allows for force that is applied linearly while simultaneously allowing rotary motion. I drew inspiration from the Kaleidocycle ([link](https://all3dp.com/2/coolest-print-in-place-3d-models/)) and designed my own as seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLitvjZWok8). I printed this in our school’s new printer, which came out great as seen in the image below (although it was quite difficult to get the supports off. I requested tree support from our manufacturing team and somehow it came out to be normal support). I found that it was not viable for our situation as seen in [this video](https://youtu.be/_A0seaw92J8). The rotary motion of the coupler was fine, but the problem mainly lay in the linear force. When applying a linear force, the inner piece sort of gets stuck in the outer piece, which doesn’t allow it to rotate. I tried to put water in to see if I could improve it with some lubricant, but it didn’t work as well. I will use the original coupler.
