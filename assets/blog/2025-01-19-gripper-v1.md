Gripper V1 is the first prototype compatible with our electrical components: Bluerobotics M200 motor and HAKIWO IP68 Waterproof 12V Linear Actuator. We chose the linear actuator as the opening and closing mechanism mainly because it is seen in other products like BlueRobotics and Reach Robotics. It could provide adequate force and speed without expensive parts due to the waterproofing. The gripper was designed to be able to hold round objects up to 3 inches in diameter. It has been designed to be as compact as possible, with the linear actuator axle coupling directly to the gripper mechanism. As the linear actuatorâ€™s axle is only 50 mm and the gripper extension mechanism is around 20 mm, we have to fit everything (the couple, the boot, and the gear/gripper holder) in 30 mm only. To save space, the coupler is placed between the gear/gripper holder and the gripper. I have also tested it ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOtYzAC4DQQ)), and found that I needed to decrease the clearance.
