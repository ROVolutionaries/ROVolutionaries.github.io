Today we tested 2 new pieces of equipment, the HDPE and the pump. For the HDPE we wanted to make sure it was positively buoyant. Me and ati clogged a sink, and filled it up with water. Then we put the HDPE panel in, and made sure it floated, which it did. Next for the pump where there are 2 things me and Ahmed tested for. Firstly if the pump worked, and secondly if we could store the water in a container. We filled a cup with water, and tested the pump normally, and it worked. However, when we added the container to the pump, no water was being sucked in from the cup. We realized this was because there were open holes in the container, meaning air was pumped instead of water. So to test our idea, we first covered the holes in scotch tape. Once we realized this was the issue we wanted a more permanent solution, so we epoxy sealed every hole around the container.
