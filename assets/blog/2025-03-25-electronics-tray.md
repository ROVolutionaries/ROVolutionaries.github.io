With the frame of the ROV constructed, the next key component is the brains of the ROV, the electronics. The electronics of the ROVolution ROV are housed in the BlueRobotics capsule enclosure. The electronics of course cannot just be placed into the capsule, they must rest on an electronics tray.

This week, I have been working closely with Konstantin, Head Electrical Engineer, to design the tray for the electronics. As it stands, we have successfully created a CAD model of the tray that attaches directly to the flange. This model has also been cut and tested to ensure it fits snugly into the capsule. 

The next step is to create holes for the electrical components to fit onto. The tray must be able to hold the following components:
- Raspberry Pi 
- Pi - Hat 
- 8 ESCs for T200s 
- Power Board 
- Gripper Board 
- Linear Actuator Driver 
- pH Sensor Board

Most of the 3D CAD Models of these components have been created by Konstantin. Whilst he finalizes the final pieces, I will be working on implementing them in a strategic manner onto the electronics tray to ensure that all the pieces fit whilst keeping wire management in mind. Once the positioning has been finalized, I can add extrusions onto the design to allow for points of attachment. Finally, these cuts will be applied to the actual real-life component which will help finalize the design.
