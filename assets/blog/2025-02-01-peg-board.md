Today I worked largely on Fusion 360 making changes to the design for the tooling Peg Board. The design was previously finalized with the utilization of aluminum standoffs to connect the board to the Aluminum sheet metal. However, we heard back from PCL who unfortunately did not have any standoffs of any kind. So I spent today reworking the design and coordinating with Ahmed to figure out an alternate solution that would still be able to deliver the requirements of the Peg Board.
