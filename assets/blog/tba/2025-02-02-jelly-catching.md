For the most part, I was correcting and finalizing my design on Fusion 360. The design consists of a cylindrical tube for catching the jellyfish, and a lid that should close using a waterproof servos and gear. I had previously tested the hinges to ensure they work, however upon further analysis and brainstorming, I concluded that it would be an inefficient design, especially with the gears, hence Iâ€™ve made it simpler and easier to print (which was an added bonus). The next steps would include finding a way to secure the gears to ensure they work as intended, as well as printing a prototype (likely out of PLA), to test the design.
