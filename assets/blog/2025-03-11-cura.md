As a part of the manufacturing team, one of the biggest headaches we had was figuring out how to use the Ultimaker Printers to print out our TPU springs without it completely failing. And looking back, I’d say it;s because we weren’t properly trained on them; we technically did but there's so much to learn about these printers (such as the dual extrusion, the printer cores, bed leveling, etc.), we simply didn’t have enough time to get through all of it, and at the time it seemed pretty unnecessary. 

The first issue that I had to overcome was the bed leveling. Often the prints wouldn’t adhere to the print bed, and ultimately fail, which was due to an issue with the machine itself, hence the PCL staff helped us fix that. The next issue was printer core in the Ultimaker printers. The printer core refers to the extruder used for filaments, and each specific filament has their own preferred printer core, which after a lot of trial and error with the PCL staff, we learnt that the optimum for TPU was AA 0.4. Finally the final issue I had to overcome was dual extrusion; essentially when printing complex shapes such as our springs, there needs to be a lot of support, which TPU is not good for, hence I had to learn to configure the printer such that it would print supports in another filament (such as Breakaway white), to ensure we had a clean print. With all of them obstacles sorted out, I now hope that 3D printing on the Ultimaker will be significantly easier.
