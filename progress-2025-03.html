                    <p>With the frame of the ROV constructed, the next key component is the brains of the ROV, the electronics. The electronics of the ROVolution ROV are housed in the BlueRobotics capsule enclosure. The electronics of course cannot just be placed into the capsule, they must rest on an electronics tray.</p>
<p>This week, I have been working closely with Konstantin, Head Electrical Engineer, to design the tray for the electronics. As it stands, we have successfully created a CAD model of the tray that attaches directly to the flange. This model has also been cut and tested to ensure it fits snugly into the capsule. </p>
<p>The next step is to create holes for the electrical components to fit onto. The tray must be able to hold the following components:<br>
 - Raspberry Pi <br>
 - Pi - Hat <br>
 - 8 ESCs for T200s <br>
 - Power Board <br>
 - Gripper Board <br>
 - Linear Actuator Driver <br>
 - pH Sensor Board</p>
<p>Most of the 3D CAD Models of these components have been created by Konstantin. Whilst he finalizes the final pieces, I will be working on implementing them in a strategic manner onto the electronics tray to ensure that all the pieces fit whilst keeping wire management in mind. Once the positioning has been finalized, I can add extrusions onto the design to allow for points of attachment. Finally, these cuts will be applied to the actual real-life component which will help finalize the design.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the year, I emphasized to our main software engineer, Ahmed, how important it was for us to be able to stabilize the ROV with PID as most high-scoring teams on the product demonstration had something like that, and it makes sense for many precision tasks that came out. However, we already came across multiple problems. A mentor that has a PhD in ROVs came up to us telling us how our max current draw is extremely low and it was important to assume maximum thrust from all thrusters to divide the current draw for each. We later on asked other teams on the Discord server, and they disagreed, saying that we should assume that there is no limit until it exceeds the limit, which it should then split the current (probably because this is a pool competition rather than an actual ROV). I’m not too sure about the specifics, but I believe it was also important to know the general thrust output of each thruster based on the PWM signal in case they were different. I watched a video from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_amdMnDMS4&amp;t=784s">Brick Experiment Channel</a> that has a clever solution to measuring the force applied. Thus, we created a setup like shown below, where we used lego to connect a <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/t200-to-lego-connector-1">3D printed part</a> that is bolted on to the T200. There were a few problems with this setup that we are planning on improving. At the start, the T200 didn’t run because of problems with the code. Then, when it ran, it was stalling (like sometimes twitching, sometimes moving), but when we rotated it the other way, it spun normally. So, Omar kickstarted the T200 by moving it and it spun normally. Also, the lego extends out from the scale and is connected by tape, the <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/yziKkib4t5Q">scale tilts</a> due to the T200. </p>
<p>Thus, we will improve the setup by adding weights on one side and redo everything.</p>

                    <p>These days, I have been working on sealing and joining the gripper and the float. So far, the o-ring seal has been successful, which shouldn’t be surprising but is definitely surprising to me. For the float flange, I designed it so that there would be a flat surface (the acrylic) and it compresses the o-ring towards a resin printed groove. From what I read, the optimal compression should be a 25% compression, and allowing DeepSeek to do all the math (ID=88mm, OD=95mm, CS=3.5mm), the groove depth should be around 2.5 mm, and the groove width should be around 4 mm. However, due to the lack of experience, I made the groove depth more shallow at 2 mm with a max compression of 42.9%. This way we could always increase the pressure in case it doesn’t work but it doesn’t go above 42.9% to avoid damaging the o-ring further (in case a team member is assigned with assembling the float). </p>
<p>Yesterday, I finished sealing the flange with epoxy and the nitrile rubber o-rings arrived, so Omar and I added the o-rings and compressed the o-ring with a few bolts (we didn’t have enough hex nuts, so we couldn’t fill the 12 holes, but rather did around 5 that were evenly spaced, but the final should probably have all 12 to distribute the pressure on the o-ring). Because Omar didn’t understand how the o-rings worked, they didn’t leave a gap in some areas of the face seal (and the 3mm acrylic kind of bends). This may cause the <a href="https://eriks.com/en/know-how-hub/blogs/o-ring-degradation-characteristics-causes-solutions/">o-ring to degrade</a>. After some DeepSeek calculations, the gap between the flanges should be around 0.5 mm to 1 mm.</p>

                    <p>As a part of the manufacturing team, one of the biggest headaches we had was figuring out how to use the Ultimaker Printers to print out our TPU springs without it completely failing. And looking back, I’d say it;s because we weren’t properly trained on them; we technically did but there's so much to learn about these printers (such as the dual extrusion, the printer cores, bed leveling, etc.), we simply didn’t have enough time to get through all of it, and at the time it seemed pretty unnecessary. </p>
<p>The first issue that I had to overcome was the bed leveling. Often the prints wouldn’t adhere to the print bed, and ultimately fail, which was due to an issue with the machine itself, hence the PCL staff helped us fix that. The next issue was printer core in the Ultimaker printers. The printer core refers to the extruder used for filaments, and each specific filament has their own preferred printer core, which after a lot of trial and error with the PCL staff, we learnt that the optimum for TPU was AA 0.4. Finally the final issue I had to overcome was dual extrusion; essentially when printing complex shapes such as our springs, there needs to be a lot of support, which TPU is not good for, hence I had to learn to configure the printer such that it would print supports in another filament (such as Breakaway white), to ensure we had a clean print. With all of them obstacles sorted out, I now hope that 3D printing on the Ultimaker will be significantly easier.</p>

                    <p>I received the TPU prints (finally!). Apparently the manufacturing team had a huge difficulty in printing in TPU. They printed with the wrong extruders at PCL multiple times, so it took a few weeks for the parts to come. In fact, they even printed my part in durable resin once, but I thought the material was a bit too stiff. </p>
<p>The TPU print was very bad quality since Shiva chose the wrong support material, but it helped me recognize the problems and potential solutions. I explained everything in the 7-minute yap session <a href="https://youtu.be/rvyLVZWc7QA">here</a> because Ahmed wanted to know what's going on (also something I forgot to mention: the first design was actually inspired by a hinge compliant mechanism I saw before where it is a circle, then I realized the shape is basically the same shape as when the spring is being compressed). As stated in the video, I’m not a professional mechanical engineer and compliant mechanisms are far beyond what I can do, so most of the stuff is just either yap or just pure instinct (hopefully the design works though).</p>

                    <p>Although the CAD model of the frame design was completed a while ago, I wanted to talk about the design choices. Because we don’t have a lot of experience with the frame, I wanted to make it as structurally sound as possible. Despite the functionality, I ruled out Atisam’s unique design and opted for something that has been done before. I read through the technical documentation of many teams mainly from the explorers class and I found <a href="https://20693798.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/20693798/EX29%20Cabrillo_Robotics_SeaHawk_Technical_Documentation_2024.pdf">Callibro’s</a>, <a href="https://20693798.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/20693798/City%20University%20of%20Hong%20Kong_CityU%20Underwater%20Robotics_technical%20documentation_2024.pdf">CityU’s</a>, and <a href="https://bluerobotics.com/store/rov/bluerov2/">Blue Robotics’</a> designs appealing due to their simplicity, which includes two planes made of aluminum or HDPE with HDPE side plates. The top plane is for the electronic capsule and motors, which were in a typical 6 or <a href="https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/frame-configuration-advantages-disadvantages/7968">8 motor configuration</a>. We chose 8 motors for 6 degrees of freedom, auto stabilisation, and the ability to pitch for the gripper and other tooling (especially as our gripper is extremely long and it would be impractical to tilt it). To save space, Ahmed wanted to build PCBs and a custom watertight box for electronics similar to many of the teams, but I also ruled this out because I was scared of waterproofing due to inexperience. Instead, we used the <a href="https://bluerobotics.com/store/watertight-enclosures/locking-series/wte-locking-tube-r1-vp/">watertight capsule</a> by Blue Robotics and found a method of placing it in a way that reduces space by bending the aluminum as seen in the images below, which was provided by Shiva from a meeting with a PCL staff. </p>
<p>For the bottom plate, we wanted to ensure structural stability but also decrease the mass similar to Callibro’s SeaHawk. I recalled from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GafRRl5XRPM">video</a> that Voronoi patterns were used in nature and they were rather strong. We used this <a href="https://websvg.github.io/voronoi/">Voronoi generator</a> with specific coordinates from the json file to create a pattern to be used for our ROV. Additionally, we had a modular tooling board to fit different tools with bolts. </p>
<p>Finally, I added as many bolt holes as possible to ensure modularity in case we needed something. </p>

                    <p>The float design has been one of my main projects in MateROV since last year. Last year, we were very lost as we had no prior experience or help from others. We had no idea how a buoyancy engine worked, and articles such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy_engine">wikipedia article</a> used methods that seemed impractical. After reading the preview mission task that required the measurement of depth, our team came up with gyro, laser pointers, and sonar. Thankfully, we found a <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Underwater-Glider/">guide from instructables</a> and decided to use syringes to modify the buoyancy. Our float consisted mainly of scrap pieces lying around, such as syringes, stepper motors that were scavenged from defunct 3D printers, and a long bolt. Additionally, we were able to 3D print parts in the TKS design room and our mentor bought us 3.5 inch PVC. The design had an electronics compartment and a buoyancy engine compartment (my friend advised me to separate the electronics from the buoyancy engine even though we didn’t know proper methods of waterproofing, so the two compartments would inevitably be stuck together with epoxy). Because the float PVC was not transparent, it was impossible to tell whether the inside was waterproofed, and we had to sometimes go by luck (for example pouring in epoxy to waterproof the syringes). The syringes were extremely difficult to pull and lubricants such as WD40 somehow made it less smooth. Thus, we had to scrap our first float because the syringes were attached to the float. Additionally, because we were using a long bolt, it was extremely difficult to couple the bolt head to the stepper motor. We messed up the coupler a few times and hours before the regional competition, we had to EpoPutty the stepper motor directly to the bolt, where it's stuck to this day (a lot of things were done extremely last minute. For example, the electric engineer literally soldered the fuse in parallel at 3am before the regional competition). Finally, we noticed that the stepper motor had absolutely no torque at all (e.g if you gently tapped the stepper motor it would’ve stopped) and even if we minimized the errors there would be no way for the float to work. Also, this year we found out that the pressure sensor we bought from Amazon didn’t work. </p>
<p>This year, I used a similar mechanism but <a href="https://youtu.be/9TrLYAlDmAg">addressed all the issues</a>:<br>
 - The entire float is able to be taken out like an electronics tray in a capsule while having proper O-ring face seals<br>
 - To decrease loss in efficiency, I used structural beams made of stainless steel to align the syringes with the stepper motor<br>
 - Used bolts from the stepper motor instead of holding it with a 3D print <br>
 - Bought a <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006104443954.html">stepper motor</a> that has relatively high torque, <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002085320555.html">lead screw set</a> that was of high quality, and a fairly transparent <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005890935183.html">PVC pipe</a> <br>
 - Expanded the hole of the syringe to decrease the force (because I am using tubing, I needed the outer circle of the syringe to make a connection. Thus, I expanded the size of the entrance by removing the middle part of the syringe. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORL7fASZpUw">method used</a> was inspired by a tale I heard about a person using needles to drill holes into postage stamps to make it easier to rip. I did the same using a hammer, a nail, and pliers to yoink the part out)<br>
 - Created a more accurate way of holding the syringe heads with 3D prints instead of drilling into the it by hand <br>
 - Used tubing rather than directly epoxy the float, which will probably allow for syringe removal if necessary <br>
 - Added a tonne of space for the electronics at the top <br>
 - Using a universal coupler for slight alignment issues (we haven’t tested this yet)</p>
<p>Although it may not be the final version, here is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AnbART2U5zjeA3a6lvJc0xrgnfLWK7QG/view?usp=sharing">STEP file</a>. </p>
<p>Right now, I’m waiting for the manufacturing team to finish the prints and for the o-rings to arrive. I’m very excited to turn the theoretical CAD files into reality! In the future, I would like to use a compact and more reliable mechanism to push and pull syringes as shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLEH8RJsYgI">this video</a> by the Lego Experiment Channel. I may also experiment with other methods shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdhM0SjlS9o">another video</a>.</p>

                    <p>One of the primary requirements of our control system was communication between a Raspberry Pi and the Raspberry Pi Pico. The reason we decided to use a Raspberry Pi along with a separate microcontroller was that there were insufficient hardware PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) channels on the Raspberry Pi to control all the servos and thrusters on the ROV along with ADC (Analog to Digital Conversion) for the pH sensor. The Pico would offer a compact and efficient solution to the lack of hardware control and take some processing load off of the Raspberry Pi, which would already handle 4-5 camera inputs and control telemetry from the surface laptop.</p>
<p>Initially, I decided on the I2C protocol for communication between the Pi and the Pico as it had the highest data rate of the ones on the Pico. However, I noticed that the language I was programming the pico in, Micropython, did not support I2C slave mode. This was an issue because the I2C protocol requires a controller and a peripheral, and setting the Raspberry Pi as a peripheral device also proved challenging. Thus, I decided to rewrite my Pico code in C++ using the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK. Despite setting up slave mode on the Pico with an interrupt handler, I could not get this connection to work. I used the same processes as the various examples I saw online. </p>
<p>Thus, I took an alternative approach and decided to use the UART communication protocol. I got this working much faster and resolved the data transfer issues quickly.</p>
