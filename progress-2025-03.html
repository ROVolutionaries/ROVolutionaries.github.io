                    <p>Throughout the year, I emphasized to our main software engineer, Ahmed, how important it was for us to be able to stabilize the ROV with PID as most high-scoring teams on the product demonstration had something like that, and it makes sense for many precision tasks that came out. However, we already came across multiple problems. A mentor that has a PhD in ROVs came up to us telling us how our max current draw is extremely low and it was important to assume maximum thrust from all thrusters to divide the current draw for each. We later on asked other teams on the Discord server, and they disagreed, saying that we should assume that there is no limit until it exceeds the limit, which it should then split the current (probably because this is a pool competition rather than an actual ROV). I’m not too sure about the specifics, but I believe it was also important to know the general thrust output of each thruster based on the PWM signal in case they were different. I watched a video from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_amdMnDMS4&amp;t=784s">Brick Experiment Channel</a> that has a clever solution to measuring the force applied. Thus, we created a setup like shown below, where we used lego to connect a <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/t200-to-lego-connector-1">3D printed part</a> that is bolted on to the T200. There were a few problems with this setup that we are planning on improving. At the start, the T200 didn’t run because of problems with the code. Then, when it ran, it was stalling (like sometimes twitching, sometimes moving), but when we rotated it the other way, it spun normally. So, Omar kickstarted the T200 by moving it and it spun normally. Also, the lego extends out from the scale and is connected by tape, the <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/yziKkib4t5Q">scale tilts</a> due to the T200. </p>
<p>Thus, we will improve the setup by adding weights on one side and redo everything.</p>

                    <p>These days, I have been working on sealing and joining the gripper and the float. So far, the o-ring seal has been successful, which shouldn’t be surprising but is definitely surprising to me. For the float flange, I designed it so that there would be a flat surface (the acrylic) and it compresses the o-ring towards a resin printed groove. From what I read, the optimal compression should be a 25% compression, and allowing DeepSeek to do all the math (ID=88mm, OD=95mm, CS=3.5mm), the groove depth should be around 2.5 mm, and the groove width should be around 4 mm. However, due to the lack of experience, I made the groove depth more shallow at 2 mm with a max compression of 42.9%. This way we could always increase the pressure in case it doesn’t work but it doesn’t go above 42.9% to avoid damaging the o-ring further (in case a team member is assigned with assembling the float). </p>
<p>Yesterday, I finished sealing the flange with epoxy and the nitrile rubber o-rings arrived, so Omar and I added the o-rings and compressed the o-ring with a few bolts (we didn’t have enough hex nuts, so we couldn’t fill the 12 holes, but rather did around 5 that were evenly spaced, but the final should probably have all 12 to distribute the pressure on the o-ring). Because Omar didn’t understand how the o-rings worked, they didn’t leave a gap in some areas of the face seal (and the 3mm acrylic kind of bends). This may cause the <a href="https://eriks.com/en/know-how-hub/blogs/o-ring-degradation-characteristics-causes-solutions/">o-ring to degrade</a>. After some DeepSeek calculations, the gap between the flanges should be around 0.5 mm to 1 mm.</p>

                    <p>As a part of the manufacturing team, one of the biggest headaches we had was figuring out how to use the Ultimaker Printers to print out our TPU springs without it completely failing. And looking back, I’d say it;s because we weren’t properly trained on them; we technically did but there's so much to learn about these printers (such as the dual extrusion, the printer cores, bed leveling, etc.), we simply didn’t have enough time to get through all of it, and at the time it seemed pretty unnecessary. </p>
<p>The first issue that I had to overcome was the bed leveling. Often the prints wouldn’t adhere to the print bed, and ultimately fail, which was due to an issue with the machine itself, hence the PCL staff helped us fix that. The next issue was printer core in the Ultimaker printers. The printer core refers to the extruder used for filaments, and each specific filament has their own preferred printer core, which after a lot of trial and error with the PCL staff, we learnt that the optimum for TPU was AA 0.4. Finally the final issue I had to overcome was dual extrusion; essentially when printing complex shapes such as our springs, there needs to be a lot of support, which TPU is not good for, hence I had to learn to configure the printer such that it would print supports in another filament (such as Breakaway white), to ensure we had a clean print. With all of them obstacles sorted out, I now hope that 3D printing on the Ultimaker will be significantly easier.</p>

                    <p>Over the course of the past 2 weeks, we have unfortunately suffered from delays in the manufacturing process. These delays came with the difficulty in cutting one of our key frame components; the HDPE side plates. These side plates are simply a 2D cut onto 3D material. Our first instinct was to lasercut the material as this was the most efficient and precise method. Unfortunately, after extensive research, we learned that HDPE releases toxic fumes that are dangerous for both the operator of the laser cutter and the laser cutter exhaust mechanism itself. Our next idea was to use the waterjets available at HFL to cut the HDPE. These were ideal as they operated similarly to laser cutters but used high pressure jets of water to cut through the material. In this way, no toxic fumes would have been released. Unfortunately, the water jets that were available were under maintenance due to technical errors in their water output. We then met with Woodrow and Ali to discuss how we could possibly cut the HDPE side plates. They suggested using the Woodpecker CNC machine available at the IFL. This also operated similarly to a laser cutter but was more manual and operated using a drill bit. To help us with this we acquired the help of Jamaal at the IFL. Jamaal helped us to develop our Fusion 360 design using the manufacturing tab to create a suitable file for the CNC to read. We first prototyped this design on some spare plywood of 8mm thickness at IFL. The major issues we ran into are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Z axis starting position was too low and required us to manually adjust the Gcode to manually set the Z starting position </li>
<li>Different sized holes on the HDPE side plate file meant that we had to continuously change drill bits throughout the cutting process</li>
<li>HDPE plate size was almost the exact dimension of the HDPE material available. This forced us to center our design on the corner of the material to leave ourselves as much clearance as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Today as we were cutting the HDPE side plate, we realized we had made a huge mistake. We accidentally centered the cut file 4 mm to the right of the corner of the HDPE material. As a result, every bolt hole was adjusted 4mm to the right. This could have caused a huge problem as the HDPE side plate would not have fit on the available material and would also not have connected properly to the Aluminium. To combat this, we simply recentered the design and cut the bolt holes again. We ensured to adjust any dimensions to ensure that no holes overlapped. As a result, one of the HDPE side plates has two sets of bolt holes. This might end up working in our favor as it provides modularity which can be used for ballast or even attachment of tooling. Additionally, the extra set of holes serve as a powerful reminder of the struggles and challenges we had to overcome to get to where we are as a team today. This is a powerful symbol that our ROV incorporates.</p>

                    <p>I received the TPU prints (finally!). Apparently the manufacturing team had a huge difficulty in printing in TPU. They printed with the wrong extruders at PCL multiple times, so it took a few weeks for the parts to come. In fact, they even printed my part in durable resin once, but I thought the material was a bit too stiff. </p>
<p>The TPU print was very bad quality since Shiva chose the wrong support material, but it helped me recognize the problems and potential solutions. I explained everything in the 7-minute yap session <a href="https://youtu.be/rvyLVZWc7QA">here</a> because Ahmed wanted to know what's going on (also something I forgot to mention: the first design was actually inspired by a hinge compliant mechanism I saw before where it is a circle, then I realized the shape is basically the same shape as when the spring is being compressed). As stated in the video, I’m not a professional mechanical engineer and compliant mechanisms are far beyond what I can do, so most of the stuff is just either yap or just pure instinct (hopefully the design works though).</p>
